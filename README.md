# Office Stare

Idea 1: (inspired by Alvaro Marques) 
  - First, use an AI to classify emotions based on The Office
  - Secondly, if you send a picture of yourself, he tries to classify your emotions/stares from the office.
Idea 2: You send a picture and the program tries to find the closes thing in its database about The Office (not necessarily emotions)
